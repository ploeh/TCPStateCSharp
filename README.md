# State pattern TCP example in C#

This small C# code base translates the [Design Patterns](https://blog.ploeh.dk/ref/dp) State example code to C#, to the best of my abilities.

It then refactors the code to pure functions.

The code is written as a technical appendix to [a blog post](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2022/09/26/refactoring-the-tcp-state-pattern-example-to-pure-functions).
